   <p class="firstP">Astronomers classify galaxies into three major categories: <b class="three">elliptical spiral irregular</b> These galaxies span a wide range of sizes
    from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars.</p><br>
    <p class="secondP">Aside from these three classic categories astronomers have also identified many unusually shaped galaxies that seem to be in a transitory phase of galactic development.
    These include those in the process of colliding or interacting, and those with active nuclei ejecting jets of gas.
